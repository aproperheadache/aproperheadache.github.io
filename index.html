            <div><h3>About</h3><p>Just a dude in Baltimore. Trying to learn to do things and use this website as a way to document my work. Primarily interested in computer science and mathematics, with a special interest in data analysis and machine learning. In an ideal world, I would be writing the most optimal, clean, and easy-to-follow code but unfortunately for me, we do not live in that world.</p><p>This website is intended to be littered with my projects and notes for codes I write for different challenges online.</p></div>
            <div><p>The website itself is under construction, and I have no idea how to do front-end work. So if the page appears ugly and annoying and pisses you off, know that I knew that was going to happen because I probably have been in your place already. Maybe I'll get better at organizing this website over time.</p></div>
